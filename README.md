# Projekt-Analiza-Danych-Baterii

This project is a report for a data analysis course. It explores and analyzes different materials used in battery technology, focusing on key properties like chemical formulas, energy density, stability, and capacity. The analysis leverages data manipulation and visualization in R to uncover trends and relationships between battery materials and their performance.
